Since Chandan did not like dirty stuffs so his son decided to scrap off all the smaller cubes that got dirty in the process. A cube that had coke on any one of its six faces was considered to be dirty and scrapped off. After completing this cumbersome part his son decided to calculate volume of the scrapped off material.
